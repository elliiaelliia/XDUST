# ðŸŒŒ XDUST

**XDUST** â€” quantum-like binary computations in a single file.  
Pure code. Living fire. Network pulse. FE ED BA BE.

A minimalist simulator of quantum-like behavior, packed into one file: `xdust.py`. Experiment with superposition, entanglement, and gates to build AI, generate music, or rewrite reality.

## What's Inside?

- **`BinaryQubit`**: Core class for binary states with weights, supporting superposition and entanglement.
- **Gates**: Hadamard, NOT, CNOT, Phase Shift for quantum-inspired transformations.
- **Superposition**: Hamming kernel to blend states.
- **Entanglement**: Simulate connections between qubits with correlation-based logic.
- **Visualization**: Text-based graph of entanglement between states.
- All in one file, powered by `numpy`.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Install `numpy`** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy

2.  Download xdust.py:
   Grab it from this repo or copy it to any folder.

3. Run:
   ```bash
   python xdust.py
